			In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed.
                        We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full
                         of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad,
                           disappointing or annoying when we can look around us, and see the wondrous things before us!
      </p>
                 <p>This can be read as "GOD IS NO WHERE" or as "GOD IS NOW HERE" everything depends on how you see it. 
                        So think positive always. Thinking positive is the key to your success.
                           All successful people have one thing in common: Positive thinking and passion for what they are doing!
