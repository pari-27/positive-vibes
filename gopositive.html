				  <p>That Positive Attitude In Life
Attitude is something that keeps one alive or dead. Laugh out loud because dead here represents the life which 
					  has no excitement, negative thoughts all around and depression. 
All you have to do is find ways to maintain that positive attitude in life
					  which will keep you smiling at every turn of your life, in every situation,
					  however hard it might be to face.</p>
<br><h3>1. Make goals and keep yourself busy in fullfiling them</h3> 
<p>Yes, you can, try to keep yourself occupied with work rather than just browsing your way through. 
				  Keeping yourself fully involved in going towards your goals, which will keep you happy,
				  takes away the opportunity for the negative thoughts to creep in.

				  <br> <h3>2.Self worth</h3><p>
You are in this world because you serve a purpose; however glorious or paltry that purpose may seem to you. 
				  Understand that you have a greater good to accomplish and set yourself on the right path. 
				  in this world has ever been useless, be it a bee or a pin, let alone you.

				  <h3>3. Start Early</h3><p> 
Morning time is always full of energy and new thoughts. Get up early in the morning and take a long serene walk to 
				  freshen up your mind with clear thoughts and plans for the upcoming day. 
				  This helps in finding an immensely positive attitude within you.

<br><h3>4.Cherish Memories</h3><p>

<br><h3>5. Meditate</h3><p>
The busy schedule these days leaves a lot of pressure and frustration in the over-worked minds, 
				  which gives birth to negativity. Meditate everyday in the morning to enhance 
				  your focus on the good things in life; concentrating with the help of rejuvenating
				  meditation helps in getting rid of stress and mind exhaustion.

<br><h3>6. Self Motivation</h3><p> 
Humans have become the puppets of their own feelings and mind. You get happy when somebody praises you,
				  but how about when somebody points out your flaws? Keep yourself motivated from inside 
				  and take the criticism with a pinch of salt.

<br><h3>7.Friends</h3><p>
Friends play an important role in venting the pent up aggravation and the general misgivings one might have about life.
				  Try to catch up with your old friends just for the sake of rewinding; nothing can make 
				  you happier than sharing the old anecdotes with your loving partners-in-crime.

<br><h3>9. Always See a Glass Half Full</h3><p>
There are many studies which have proved that whatever you see, feel, do and think in a positive sense  drastically
				  changes your thought process and increases the protons – the positively charged 
				  particles of your thought process.

<br><h3>10.Books helps</h3><p>
There is nothing more comforting than enjoying a good book and let yourself immerse into a whole world of fictional paradise.
				  Or non-fiction, if that’s what you are into. Pick the book you have been thinking of reading
				  for a long timeand surrender yourself to the pleasure only a book lover knows. 
Positive attitude is not only a way to live life; it is a way to make others happier and content with you. 
				  shed all the heavy burden you think you are carrying on your shoulder and be grateful for 
				  all the gifts you have been bestowed upon.
