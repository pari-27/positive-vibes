			In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed.
                        We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full
                         of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad,
                           disappointing or annoying when we can look around us, and see the wondrous things before us!<br>
      This can be read as "GOD IS NO WHERE" or as "GOD IS NOW HERE" everything depends on how you see it. 
                        So think positive always. Thinking positive is the key to your success.
                           All successful people have one thing in common: Positive thinking and passion for what they are doing!<br>
<br>
A positive attitude helps you cope more easily with the daily affairs of life. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more successful.

With a positive attitude you see the bright side of life, become optimistic, and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.
