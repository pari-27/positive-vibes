				  <div class="quote">That Positive Attitude In Life
Attitude is something that keeps one alive or dead. Laugh out loud because dead here represents the life which has no excitement, negative thoughts all around and depression. 
All you have to do is find ways to maintain that positive attitude in life which will keep you smiling at every turn of your life, in every situation, however hard it might be to face.
1. Make goals and keep yourself busy in fullfiling them

Yes, you can, try to keep yourself occupied with work rather than just browsing your way through. Keeping yourself fully involved in going towards your goals, which will keep you happy, takes away the opportunity for the negative thoughts to creep in.
2. Self worth
You are in this world because you serve a purpose; however glorious or paltry that purpose may seem to you. Understand that you have a greater good to accomplish and set yourself on the right path. Nothing in this world has ever been useless, be it a bee or a pin, let alone you.
3. Wake Up Early 
Morning time is always full of energy and new thoughts. Get up early in the morning and take a long serene walk to freshen up your mind with clear thoughts and plans for the upcoming day. This helps in finding an immensely positive attitude within you.
4. Good Memories 
Whenever you are free to think anything, try to think about your good times in past. This energizes you with a positive sense of living.
5. Meditate
The busy schedule these days leaves a lot of pressure and frustration in the over-worked minds, which gives birth to negativity. Meditate everyday in the morning to enhance your focus on the good things in life; concentrating with the help of rejuvenating meditation helps in getting rid of stress and mind exhaustion.
6. Self Motivation 
Humans have become the puppets of their own feelings and mind. You get happy when somebody praises you, but how about when somebody points out your flaws? Keep yourself motivated from inside and take the criticism with a pinch of salt.
7. Chat with Friends
Friends play an important role in venting the pent up aggravation and the general misgivings one might have about life. Try to catch up with your old friends just for the sake of rewinding; nothing can make you happier than sharing the old anecdotes with your loving partners-in-crime.
8. Drink a Lot of Water
Hydrating your body helps in keeping various ailments at bay, not to say it works wonders in keeping you radiant. Sip a glass of cool water at regular intervals and that will be enough to make you feel bright.
9. Always See a Glass Half Full
There are many studies which have proved that whatever you see, feel, do and think in a positive sense  drastically changes your thought process and increases the protons – the positively charged particles of your thought process. 
10. Read Books
There is nothing more comforting than enjoying a good book and let yourself immerse into a whole world of fictional paradise. Or non-fiction, if that’s what you are into. Pick the book you have been thinking of reading for a long timeand surrender yourself to the pleasure only a book lover knows. 
Positive attitude is not only a way to live life; it is a way to make others happier and content with you. shed all the heavy burden you think you are carrying on your shoulder and be grateful for all the gifts you have been bestowed upon.
