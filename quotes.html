	 The pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. <b>Winston Churchill</b><br>
You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.<b> Albert Einstein</b><br>
Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness. <b>Oprah Winfrey</b><br> 
A man is but the product of his thoughts; what he thinks, he becomes. <b>Mahatma Gandhi</b><br>
I am an optimist. It does not seem to be much use being anything else. <b>Winston Churchill</b><br>
Attitudes are contagious. Is yours worth catching</div></div>
